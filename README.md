 Finding the ids of products that are both low fat and recyclable.
 Colons can be used to align columns.

| Column        | Type        |
| ------------- |:-----------:|
| produt_id     | int         |
| low_facts     | enum        |
| recyclabe     | enum        |

- *product_id* is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
- *low_fats* is an ENUM (category) of type ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is low fat and 'N' means it is not.
- *recyclable* is an ENUM (category) of types ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is recyclable and 'N' means it is not.
